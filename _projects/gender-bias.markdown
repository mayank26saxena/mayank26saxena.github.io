*Supervisors:* [Dr. Sameep Mehta](researcher.watson.ibm.com/view.php?person=in-sameepmehta), [Dr. Nishtha Madaan](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=in-nishthamadaan)

Worked on the problem of Detection and Analysis of Gender Stereotyping in Bollywood Movies. Under the mentor-ship of Drs. Sameep Mehta and  Nishtha Madaan, I analyzed movie script and trailers data (collected from Wikipedia/YouTube) based on gender and emotion detection using Text Analytic, Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques. Our work has led to a paper accepted at the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT*) 2018 and paper submission to  the AAAI/ACM Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Ethics and Society (AIES) 2018. We have also curated the first publicly-available, large-scale dataset to analyze gender bias in film. Our research presented ideas of how to "de-bias" and write gender-neutral plots. This work led to a paper submission to the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC) 2018. Our research received coverage in multiple national newspapers and leading websites as well.
