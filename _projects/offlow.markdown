Offlow requires the most basic hardware in a device (only a speaker and microphone) for information transfer between two devices. It is especially feasible in situations where there is no internet connection. The best use case is making payments between a retailer and customer offline and communication during a natural disaster when there is no cellular network. Sharing of data is made possible by using audio waves, specifically - ultrasonic waves, which can carry data efficiently and are inaudible to human ears. These audio waves are processed and made suitable for transmission using Fourier transform algorithm. The security of data is ensured by using TOTP (Time-based One time password) mechanism. The payment solution works even when both the mobile devices are in Airplane Mode.
