The goal of this app is to track nutritional content of what the user consumes with a simple snap of the food item. Using Computer Vision & Machine Learning techniques, the app processes the image of a food item, retrieves nutritional content and also suggests recipes based on the user's daily calorie limit goal.

### Awards
This application won the 2nd runners up prize out of 40 entries at Hack NSIT 2016.
