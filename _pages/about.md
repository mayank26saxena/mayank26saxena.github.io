I am a senior year undergraduate in the Department of Applied Mathematics at [Delhi Technological University](http://dtu.ac.in/). My research interests lie in Machine Learning, Network Analysis and Data Mining.

In the summers of 2017, I was selected for the [Robotics Institute Summers Scholars Program](http://riss.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) and worked under the mentorship of [Dr. Jack Mostow](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mostow/). I have also conducted collaborative research with [Dr. Sameep Mehta](http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=in-sameepmehta) at [IBM IRL](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/), New Delhi.

Besides my academic engagements - I enjoy using technology to solve daily life problems, playing football and supporting Chelsea Football Club.
